# WHAT IS AN API?




# SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS ONE PIECE OF SOFTWARE TO TALK TO ANOTHER




# a set of definitions, protocols and tools for building software


# a method of communication between software components


# a source of software building blocks 
# the building blocks are then put together by the programmer









# MISCELLANEOUS API STUFF


# a REST API works similarly to a website

	# - you make a call to a server 
	# - you get data back via the HTTP protocol

# there are similarities between a REST API call and loading up a web page

	# eg make an API request to Facebook's graph API
	# GET THE RESPONSE IN YOUR BROWSER
	# THE RESPONSE YOU GET IS JSON-FORMATTED DATA

# JSON javascript objject notation

	# JSON data is organised in key-value pairs
	# lightweight data-interchange format.
	# easy for humans to read and write. 
	# easy for machines to parse and generate.


# an API allows me to connect my app to the server of a web-based service
	
	# by coding the services into my app
	# by coding the API into my app
	# i can use the company's services in my app
	# i can use their infrastructure and bring more services to my users
	# an API opens an interface that i can connect to via my app
	# i can have an API on my app's back-end server
	# eg if i use a server for my content and user management








# WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING ARE TRUE?

# the API makes the call?
# the API receives the call?
# the call passes through the API?
# the call uses API rules or API language?








# WHAT ARE SOME CONTENTS OF AN API?


# specifications for routines

# data structures

# object classes 

# variables 

# remote calls







# WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF A WEB API?


# to give out their data

# to allow your web application communicate with that data

# to allow you make new data






# WHAT WORK ENVIRONMENT DO YOU NEED FOR WORKING WITH APIs?


# Windows, linux or mac

# Python

# A code editor

# A REST client eg Postman





# WHAT IS REST?


# An architectural style 

# specifies constraints for creating web services

# REpresentational State Transfer







# WHAT IS A WEB SERVICE?


# A method of communication between two devices over a network






# WHY GET DATA FROM A DEVICE'S REST API (USING PYTHON)?

# there is an explosion of IP connected devices 

# networks are scaling ever larger

# becoming more cumbersome to manage networks using CLI commands

# easier to manage networks using code/programmatic approach







# WHaT IS POSTMAN?


# REST client

# makes it easier to interact with and interrogate a device's REST API

# previously available as extension to google chrome browser

# postman interceptor comes pre-installed
