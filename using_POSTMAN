# WHAT IS POSTMAN?

 # A REST client
 # makes it easier to interact with and interrogate a device's REST API
 # previously available as extension to google Chrome browser
 # postman interceptor now comes pre-installed with Chrome browser?
 


# WHAT ADVANTAGE DOES POSTMAN PROVIDE?

 # Best practice (WHEN WRITING DATA TO A REST API) is to put the data in the body of the request
 	# A normal web browser doesn't let you put data in the body of the request
 	# ADVANTAGE: you can put data in the body of a request using Postman
 
 # E.G. USING THE 'POST' METHOD WITHIN POSTMAN, SEND A TWEET FROM A TWITTER ACCOUNT VIA THE TWITTER API
 	# TO DO THIS YOU NEED AUTHENTICATION
	
	# FOR AUTHENTICATION MANY BIG WEBSITES USE OAUTH OR OAUTH2
 
 	# IN AUTHENTICATION YOU OBTAIN CREDENTIALS
	
		# CLIENT ID AND CLIENT SECRET
	
	# YOU EXCHANGE THE CREDENTIALS FOR AN ACCESS TOKEN
	
	# YOU PASS THE ACCESS TOKEN TO THE WEBSITE
	
	# THE WEBSITE KNOWS THE REQUEST IS COMING FROM YOU, AND SO HONOURS THE REQUEST
	
	
# STEPS
 # 1 create an account at https://developer.twitter.com
 # 2 create your first app
 # 3 go to the 'Keys and Access Tokens' tab and obtain the following:
 	# Consumer Key
	# Consumer Secret
	# Access Token
	# Token Secret
 # 4 Obtain your request url. To do this
 	# go back to the home page of your twitter developer account
	
	# hover above your username in the top right hand corner and from the menu that drops down, select Get Started
	
	# go to the 'Start using the endpoints!' section and click on API reference list
	
	# from the list click on the API you require and copy the url from the page that is displayed
	
	# to obtain a url for posting a twitter status update, we will click on 'POST statuses/update'
 	# copy the request url https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json (i.e. you want a json formatted response)
 # 5 open Postman and create a new request
 # 6 select POST as your request method and paste the request url in the field
 # 7 go to the 'Authorization' tab
 	# set Authorization Type to OAuth 1.0
	
	# Enter your 
		# Consumer Key
		# Consumer Secret
		# Access Token
		# Token Secret
 # 8 go to the 'Body' tab 
 	# select the 'x-www-form-urlencoded' option
	
	# write 'status' in the 'Key' field and your desired message in the 'Value' field
 # 9 hit the send button
 # 10 to post a new status update, 
	
	# go to the 'Body' tab - step 8 above -  and write your message in the 'Value' field
	
	# then go to the 'Authorization' tab and click on 'Update Request' in the upper right corner
	
	# hit the send button
