# WHAT IS AN API?


# tools for building software

# method of communication between components

# provides building blocks which are put together by the programmer






# WHAT ARE THE 5 CONTENTS OF AN API?


# specifications for routines

# data structures

# object classes 

# variables 

# remote calls







# WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF A WEB API?


# to give out their data

# to allow your web application communicate with that data

# to allow you make new data






# WHAT WORK ENVIRONMENT DO YOU NEED FOR WORKING WITH APIs?


# Windows, linux or mac

# Python

# A code editor

# A REST client eg Postman





# WHAT IS REST?


# An architectural style 

# specifies constraints for creating web services

# REpresentational State Transfer







# WHAT IS A WEB SERVICE?


# A method of communication between two devices over a network






# WHY GET DATA FROM A DEVICE'S REST API (USING PYTHON)?

# there is an explosion of IP connected devices 

# networks are scaling ever larger

# becoming more cumbersome to manage networks using CLI commands

# easier to manage networks using code/programmatic approach







# WHaT IS POSTMAN?


# REST client

# makes it easier to interact with and interrogate a device's REST API

# previously available as extension to google chrome browser

# postman interceptor comes pre-installed
